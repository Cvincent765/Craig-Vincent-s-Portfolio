                    <h2>Bio</h2>
                    <p>Johnson is half-Black and half-Samoan. His father, Rocky Johnson, is a Black Canadian
                        and part of the first Black tag team champions in WWE history along with Tony Atlas.
                        His mother is Samoan and the daughter of Peter Maivia, who was also a pro wrestler.
                        Maivia's wife, Lia, was the first female pro wrestling promoter, taking over Polynesian 
                        Pacific Pro Wrestling after her husband's death in 1982, until 1988. Through his grandfather 
                        Maivia, Johnson is considered a non-blood relative to the Anoa'i wrestling family.
                        In 2008, Johnson inducted his father and grandfather into 
                        the WWE Hall of Fame.</p>

                       <p>Johnson married Dany Garc√≠a on May 3, 1997.
                            Their only child together, a daughter named Simone, was born in August 2001.
                             On June 1, 2007, they announced they were splitting up amicably.
                             Johnson then began dating Lauren Hashian, daughter of Boston drummer Sib Hashian. 
                             They first met in 2006 while Johnson was filming The Game Plan.
                            Their first child together, Jasmine, was born in December 2015; their second child, 
                            Tiana, was born in April 2018.
                    </p>

                    <p>As of 2014, Johnson has a home in Southwest Ranches, Florida, as well as Los Angeles, California. 
                        He also owns a farm in Virginia. In 2009, Johnson gained citizenship in Canada in honor of 
                        his father's background. Though Johnson was previously registered as a Republican, he voted for 
                        Barack Obama in the 2008 and 2012 United States presidential elections and is now an 
                        independent voter. He stated he did not vote in the 2016 U.S. election.</p>

                                In recognition of his service to the Samoan people, and because he is a descendant
                                 of Samoan chiefs, Johnson had the noble title of Seiuli bestowed upon him by
                                  Malietoa Tanumafili II during his visit there in July 2004.
                                   He received a partial Samoan pe'a tattoo on his left side in 2003, and 
                                   in 2017, had the small "Brahma bull" tattoo on his right arm covered with a 
                                   larger half-sleeve tattoo of a bull's skull.
